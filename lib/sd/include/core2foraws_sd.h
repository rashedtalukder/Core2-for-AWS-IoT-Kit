/**
 * @brief Initializes and mounts the SD card.
 *
 * @note The SD card must be mounted before use. The SD card
 * and the screen share the same SPI bus, with each device 
 * having it's own CS line. Frequent writes to the SD card 
 * can slow screen writes. File I/O is split into bounded chunks so
 * display flushes can acquire the shared bus between chunks. To protect
 * access to the device, a mutex has been placed for each of SD
 * card APIs to make it thread-safe in the event there are
 * multiple tasks attempting to access the device at once.
 *
 * The example code below mounts the SD card on the mount point 
 * `/sdcard` and then writes a file named `kit.txt` with the 
 * contents "Hello from AWS IoT Kit!":
 *
 * **Example:**
 * @code{c}
 *  #include <stdint.h>
 *  #include "core2foraws.h"
 * 
 *  static const char *TAG = "MAIN_SD_DEMO";

 * @brief Removes the FAT partition and unmounts the SD-Card. Unmount

 * @note The SD Card must be mounted before use. The SD card

 * file operations and display DMA automatically; applications must not take
 * the shared SPI semaphore around this API.
 *
 * @note Every wait on the shared SPI bus is bounded by
 * @ref CORE2FORAWS_SPI_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS, so a stalled display transfer returns
 * `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT` rather than blocking the caller indefinitely.
