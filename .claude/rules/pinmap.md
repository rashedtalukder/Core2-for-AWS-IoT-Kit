# Add-On Sockets

The M5GO-Bottom2 for AWS expansion board adds two Grove (HY2.0-4P) ports plus

# Shared Pin Constraints

## Shared SPI bus

```
LCD + SD share SPI
```

Drivers must coordinate.

---

## Shared reset line

```
LCD_RST used by LCD and touch
```

Driven by AXP192 GPIO4 (NMOS open-drain), not an ESP32 GPIO.

---

## Shared audio clock

```
GPIO0 used by speaker LRCK and microphone CLK
```

Audio drivers must coordinate initialization.

---

## External I2C shared bus

Devices:

```
external Port A "unit" accessories only
```

No on-board peripheral uses this bus.

---

# Driver Initialization Order

Recommended BSP startup sequence:

```
1 Initialize ESP32 core
2 Initialize AXP192 PMU
3 Enable required power rails
4 Initialize internal I2C bus
5 Initialize external I2C bus
6 Initialize touch + RTC
7 Initialize IMU + secure element
8 Initialize SPI bus
9 Initialize LCD
10 Initialize SD card
11 Initialize audio subsystem
12 Initialize RGB LED chain
13 Initialize external sockets
```

# Audio Subsystem Constraints

Speaker:

```
GPIO0
GPIO12
GPIO2
```

Microphone:

```
GPIO0
GPIO34
```

Shared clock pin:

```
GPIO0
```

Audio drivers must avoid conflicting configurations.

---

# Reserved Pins

The BSP must not repurpose these:

```
GPIO0  audio + boot strap
GPIO1  UART0 TX
GPIO3  UART0 RX
GPIO6-11 flash
GPIO16-17 PSRAM
GPIO23 SPI MOSI
GPIO18 SPI SCK

# Summary

This board should be modeled as:

```
ESP32 system with:
- PMU-managed power rails
- shared SPI display/storage bus
- two independent I2C buses
- shared audio clock line
- external expansion board consuming multiple GPIO
```

Drivers must account for:

```
shared buses
shared reset lines
shared audio clock
PMU-controlled power rails
```
